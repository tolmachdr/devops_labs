# Python application

## Fastapi framework

I used Fastapi because it is easy and fast. I've already worked with it and like it.


## Best practice

I used `black` to check the format of my code

## Testing

I checked my app manually and by command
```curl http://127.0.0.1:8000```

## Unit testing best practices

1. ` pytest` for writing and running unit tests

2. TestClient for API Testing (to simulate requests and responses)

3. The test ensures that the Moscow time returned by the API is accurate

4. Tests are integrated into GitHub Actions to ensure automatic validation.
