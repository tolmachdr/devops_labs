# StatefulSet

## Exploration and Optimization

### `kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc`

```bash
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs$ kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc

dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs$
```

Check the visits.txt

```bash
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl exec python-app-0 -- cat /data/visits.txt
11
command terminated with exit code 1
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl exec python-app-1 -- cat /data/visits.txt
4
```

This occurs because each of the pods has its own volume where it stores 
its own visits.txt file. And the service load balancer routes requests to 
different pods at different requests. So, reading from these files gives us 
different unsychronized results.

### Pode deletion

```bash
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl exec python-app-0 -- cat /data/visits.txt
11
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl delete pod python-app-0
pod "python-app-0" deleted
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc

dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl exec python-app-0 -- cat /data/visits.txt
11
```

### DNS lookup

For some reason command `kubectl exec app-stateful-0 -- nslookup app-stateful-1.app-stateful` does not work for me, so i did it my way

```bash
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl exec python-app-0 -- nslookup python-app-1.python-app
OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: "nslookup": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown
command terminated with exit code 126
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl exec -it python-app-0 -- /bin/sh
$ nslookup python-app-1.python-app
/bin/sh: 1: nslookup: not found
$ python3 -c "import socket; print(socket.gethostbyname('python-app-1.python-app'))"
10.244.0.15
$ exit


dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl exec python-app-1 -- nslookup python-app-0.python-app
OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: "nslookup": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown
command terminated with exit code 126
dasha@LAPTOP-382BEF3K:~/devops/devops_labs/k8s$ kubectl exec -it python-app-1 -- /bin/sh
$ python3 -c "import socket; print(socket.gethostbyname('python-app-0.python-app'))"    
10.244.0.16
```

## Livenes and Readiness probes

Livenes and Readiness probes are simply requests made by kubelet to make sure the container is up and running and ready to accept connections. 
They are needed to make sure that Kubernetes starts the container that needs to do the work, and it is alive. 

## OnDelete and RollingUpdate

OnDelete is an update strategy for StatefulSets where pods are 
manually deleted for updates. RollingUpdate updates pods one by 
one, ensuring that a specified number of pods remain available.
RollingUpdate also update pods one by one, but OnDelete is not 
available for Deploymentsâ€”updates are automatically handled when 
a change is made to the Deployment spec. StatefulSets benefit 
from OnDelete when specific pod management is required, whereas 
Deployments use RollingUpdate for automatic, progressive updates 
without manual intervention.
