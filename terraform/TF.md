# Terraform

## Best practice

1. Use `.gitignore` file

2. Before running, use `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` to check configuration

## Docker

### `terraform state list`

### `terraform output`

![img1.png](/attachments/img_2.png)


## Yandex

The difficulties were getting a grant from yandex 
for a free virtual machine. Also, for some reason, 
there were problems when I specified the path to the 
file with the public key, it said that it simply 
did not exist. I ended up adding it to a variable.


I followed the instructions to set up everything, there was an
example of main.tf, it was really helpful.
