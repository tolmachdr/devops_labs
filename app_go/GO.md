# Go Application

## Standard library`net/http`

It my first time to make go web app, so I decided to use the simpliest
library `net/http` from go docs.

## Best practice

I used gofmt for code formatting

## Testing

Here I also checked my app manually and by command
```curl http://127.0.0.1:8000```
